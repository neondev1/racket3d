# racket3d
3D rendering engine written in BSL (Racket) with [SPD](https://github.com/GregorKiczales/spd) tags and style rules

### Style Rule Deviations
- The structure name for data type Triangle is `tri` due to an overlap with `triangle` from 2htdp/image
- Data definition examples are named without abbreviation for single word type names in order to prevent overlap and improve readability. For example, data type `Object` has an example named `OBJECT1`. Multi-word type names follow standard style rules.
